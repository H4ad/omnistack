## :book: Introduction

For this OmniStack, instead of using Express, I preferred to use NestJS with Express Adater instead because it uses TypeScript.

## :memo: Structure

For this project, we have three main applications:

- api: Deals with basic crud operations in the system.
- analytics: Aggregates all data of requests in API service.
- heartbeat: Just a simple microservice to show the integration between two microservices (heartbeat and analytics).

## :rocket: Getting Started

To be able to run those applications, first you need to have:

- NodeJS 16.x
- Docker Compose

After having these requirements, run:

```bash
cp .env.postgres.example .env
```

This will create the .env file to us to be able to start the application, then:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will spinning up the databases used and all the services needed.

Then, you just need to start the default API, analytics microservice and heartbeat microservice:

```bash
npm run start:api:debug
npm run start:analytics:debug
npm run start:heartbeat:debug
```

> HINT: If you have tmux and tmuxinator, just run: tmuxinator .

# :helicopter: About Microservices

In this API release, I added the analytics microservice that aggregates the count of requests per service (currently only one) and per route path (per service).

This aggregation works by a middleware called AnalyticsMiddleware, which gets the request information and sends it to the analytics microservice via MQTT.

In the analytics microservice, I store the data using Redis and Redis Rank, a library that allows us to create rankings very easily.
The idea behind it is to be able to see which routes are most consumed by users, with this architecture, it is very easy to extend to add, for example, aggregation by user ip.

# :hammer: Testing

For easy testing, you can download [omnistack-trilon.har](./omnistack-trilon.har) and import into your HTTP client such as Insomnia.

So you can just create a user and login, after these steps you can call any method inside the API.

Also, you can find the swaggers in the following links:

- [Swagger of the Analytics](http://localhost:3001/swagger)
